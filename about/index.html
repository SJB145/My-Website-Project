                <div class="half-width">
                    <p>I’ve made my home base in Phoenix, Arizona, with my small growing family. 
                        Before coding, I was a registered dietitian, providing interventions for patients with 
                        nutrition problems. While I enjoyed working in this field, there was always 
                        something missing. I found Skillcrush and began my coding journey. I was hooked 
                        and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="half-width">
                    <p>That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to 
                        build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom &amp; 
                        versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I’ve made a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.
